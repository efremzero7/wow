## Installation

Download the package and extract it into `<Game>\_retail_\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns` prior to launching the game.

## Usage

Type `/focused` to get started. Both your charater's and your target's health bars are going to appear near the center of the screen. Move around any of them, and the other will mirror the movement. Select `Apply` to retain your configuration or `Discard` to undo. Type `/focused` again any time you want to move them around. Type `/focused reset` to reset the frame to their default position. This feature does not interfere with the option to move these frames around via the `Unlock Frame` option.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Focused` folder in your add-ons directory.

Please note that uninstalling the add-on won't restore your character's and target's health position. That's because it's being handled by the _layout cache_ of the game. To **restore the default position** use `/focused reset`.
