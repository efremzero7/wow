> Tether your character's and your target's portraits together.

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/haggen/wow/releases) and extract it into `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` prior to launching the game.

## Usage

Upon logging in after the add-on's been installed the default position of your character's and target's portrait will be close to the center of the screen. If you have moved these around you might want to reset their position via the right-click menu. Now whenever you move either of them, the other will mirror this movement across the vertical axis.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Focused` folder from your add-ons directory.

Please note that uninstalling the add-on won't restore your character's and target's portrait position. For that you'll need to reset their position via the right-click menu.
