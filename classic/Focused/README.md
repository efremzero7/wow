# Focused

> Tether your character's and your target's portraits together.

## About

![Video showing off the add-on in action](https://i.imgur.com/WHc1hCv.gifv)

1. Changes the default position of your character's and target's portraits, so if you right-click them and select Move Frame > Reset Position they go to the center of the screen.
2. Tether the portraits together so when you drag one around, the other follows, mirroring the movement across the vertical axis.
3. When status bar text is enabled in Interface Options displays the target's health percentage over its health bar.

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/haggen/wow/releases) and extract it into `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns` prior to launching the game.

## Usage

Upon logging in after the add-on's been installed the default position of your character's and target's portrait will be close to the center of the screen. If you have moved these around you might want to reset their position via the right-click menu. Now whenever you move either of them, the other will mirror this movement across the vertical axis.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Focused` folder in your add-ons directory.

Please note that uninstalling the add-on won't restore your character's and target's portrait position. For that you'll need to reset their position via the right-click menu.
