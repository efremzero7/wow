# Threatrack

> Watch out for possible threats nearby.

## About

**Threatrack** continually scans for hostile player activity around you, informing whenever it can, know who and how many are there.

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/haggen/wow/releases) and extract it into `World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns` before launching the game.

## Usage

You don't need to do anything. **Threatrack** just sits on the top part of your screen, ever watchful. Whenever an enemy player presence is detected, a picture of their Class will appear, along with their level, if the information is either available or can be guessed. If you move your cursor over the picture a tooltip will appear with further information, such as the player's name and Race.

When there're too many players, it'll collapse into a stacked mode where it'll only show one picture for each Class detected, and the tooltip will now display a list of players.

After a while with no further activity, their presence is considered stale and the corresponding pictures are removed from the screen.

## Uninstall

Simply delete the `Threatrack` folder from your add-ons directory.
